<p> (Dos, Uno, Tres)

	Washin' some spuds	Choppin' them up	Cookin' my lunch	(Jansson's frestelse)	Swedish casserole	But while I'm chopping	I drop a chunk and	It makes me stoppen	(What in the hellse)	It switched my bluetooth on

	Did you know	That you can control your phone	With a piece of potato
Did they mean	For my LCD screen	To be responsive to a root vegetable	What's the point of this functionality?	Are they catering for potates with opposable thumbs that can read?	I can't help thinking that must be a pretty limited market

		But wait	Now my brain is all like	Maybе the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook	Is secrеtly a potato disguised as a human	Who's worked his way up into the boardroom

	And he keeps trying to pitch features that are specifically geared towards potatoes, and he's like	Greetings fellow humans	And they're like, I hate how he starts every meeting like that. Typical corporate exec, he can't remember anyone's name. And he's like	I've got an idea for an app	Okay, well does it have broad appeal? Because, honestly, most of your ideas have been unworkably specific	Have you heard of Uber?	Have we... have we heard of Uber?	The most downloaded ride hailing app in the world? Yes I think most of	I'm just spit-balling here, but what about 'Tuber'	What's tuber?	An app that matches tuberous roots for the purpose of getting freaky asexually
Again, I'm not sure there's a demographic for this. You know, it's kind of like your app for destroying all the peelers. Also as CEO you shouldn't really be pitching apps at all. It's, it's really more of a sales and operations role

		Did you know	That you can control your phone	With a piece of potato	Have you seen	If it touches the screen	You can personal hotspot enable	(What a lucky vegetable)	What a random bit of functionality	(How strange)	I wonder how that happened	Hahaha, it's a real mystery	No I don't think that someone could have tampered with the schematics
